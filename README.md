# A curated collection of notes in mathematics

This repository contains a set of LaTeX typeset notes that I have compiled over the past five years and they cover a range of introductory topics in mathematics, spanning both undergraduate and postgraduate level material.

They are not intended as original research contributions, but rather as a concise and organized reference of tools and concepts that I have found useful throughout my work.

Each subdirectory loosely corresponds to a branch of mathematics. The structure is kept consistent across all the subdirectoris and follows the scheme

```bash
SubdirName/
├── doc/    # LaTeX source files and compiled PDF of the notes
├── inc/    # Include files collecting the source code in src/ 
├── sim/    # Scripts used to generate the figures in the notes
└── src/    # Functions and modules used by the scripts in sim/ 
```
