\subsection{Overcoming the slow decay}\label{subsec:overcoming_slow_decay}

In 2018, Reiss and colleagues \cite{Reiss18} proposed a pre-processing technique called shifted-POD (sPOD) to overcome at least the slow Kolmogoroff $n-$width decay for more efficient model reduction of transport-dominated PDEs.
It proposes to take each non-stationary solution generated at offline stage and map it (shift) back to the IC.
In this way, intuitevely, the pre-processed snapshot matrix $\boldsymbol{X}_{s}$ will feature a much faster decay of the singular values and only very few basis functions will be needed to span $\mathcal{R}_{h}$.
