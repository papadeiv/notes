\section{Shifted-POD (sPOD)}\label{sec:sPOD}

The main take away from Section \ref{sec:setup}, aside from the principles of POD-Galerkin methods, is that transport-dominated models struggle to be represented in ROM.
The principal reason for this is the slow Kolmogoroff $n-$width decay as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:conservation_decay}.
While a rigorous mathematical justification for slow Kolmogoroff $n-$width is pathological for hyperbolic PDEs is available in the literature, it remains outside of the scope of this paper and will thus rely on the qualitative description given below.
The advection operator generates snapshots that, in the case of localised pulses as in \eqref{eq:conservation}, move around the domain.
The singular vectors forming the reduced manifold basis will thus be forced to capture this localisation as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:conservation_rom}, hence the slow decay.
