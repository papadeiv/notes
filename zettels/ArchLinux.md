# ArchLinux 

Always follow the steps and refer to the detailed [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) on the official ArchLinux Wiki. 

## Pre-installation
1. Have a separate PC available to you to read the instructions, check tutorials etc...
2. Have a USB stick of at least 16 GB 
3. Download and install balenaEtcher
4. Format the USB stick via the Disks app (on Linux) using the FAT type
5. Download the [archlinux iso](https://archlinux.org/download/)
6. Flash the iso onto the USB stick with balenaEtcher
7. Once completed the flash, safely remove the USB stick
8. On the target PC where you want to install ArchLinux, disable [SecureBoot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Disabling_Secure_Boot)
```bash
Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Advance startup (Restart now) > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings (Restart)
```

## Installation
1. Reboot your system and [access the UEFI/BIOS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Before_booting_the_OS) of your system's firmware. On Windows this can be done without rebooting: 
```bash
Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Advance startup (Restart now) > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings (Restart)
```
2. In the UEFI change the boot priority order to point to the flashed USB stick as the first device. Typically it would be:
```bash
Startup > Boot > Boot priority order 
```
Save and exit.
3. Upon rebooting you'll be prompted with the boot loader. Select _Arch Linux install medium_ and press __Enter__
4. After the safety checks you'll be presented with the `zsh` terminal and logged in as `root` in the virtual console
5. [Connect to the internet](https://www.debugpoint.com/connect-wifi-terminal-linux/) via Wifi
```bash
iwctl
[iwd]# device list                       // Lists the device in the network manager
[iwd]# station wlan0 scan                // Outputs nothing 
[iwd]# station wlan0 get-networks        // It will lists the available wifi networks 
[iwd]# station wlan0 connect wifi_name   // Select the wifi_name network from the list (security type has to be psk) 
[iwd]# exit 
ping archlinux.org                       // Check that the connection is established
// Ctrl + c                              // Stops the ping command 
```
6. Update `pacman` mirror list
```bash
sudo rm -R /var/lib/pacman/sync          // To avoid GPGME error on the following command
pacman -Syy
```
7. Type `archinstall` and press __Enter__ (the rest of the instructions can be found [here](https://www.debugpoint.com/archinstall-guide/))
8. If the `archinstall` script allowed to select before hand your desktop environment then at the end you can select `no` to boot as `chroot` and then `shutdown -h now`

## Post-install
Immediately after rebooting and logging into your new arch installation open the terminal (`Konsole` if you choose the KDE Plasma DE)

1. Update the system
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```
2. Preparation to instal `yay` which is an [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages) helper (essentially it helps you find and install a lot more packages) 
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
```
3. Install `yay`
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makapkg -si
cd ../ && rm -r yay-bin
```
4. Update once more
```bash
sudo yay -Syu
```
5. Install a bunch of stuff: browser, editor, terminal, shell prompt, app launcher and status bar
```bash
sudo yay -S google-chrome neovim wl-clipboard python-pynvim kitty extra/starship rofi 
```
[nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) icons and logos
```bash
sudo yay -S extra/otf-geist-mono-nerd extra/texlive-fontsextra extra/xorg-fonts-misc extra/freetype2 extra/adwaita-icon-theme extra/bdf-unifont aur/siji-git extra/ttf-linux-libertine 
```
developer's tools
```bash
sudo yay -S juliaup openssH xournalpp 
```
multimedia packages
```bash
sudo yay -S kvantum zathura vlc flameshot 
```
