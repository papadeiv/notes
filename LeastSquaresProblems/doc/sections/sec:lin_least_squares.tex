Check out this source \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares}}.
A least-squares problem is said to be linear if it is linear w.r.t. the parameter $\mu\in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ even though the relationship in the data between the independent $x_{j}$ and dependent variables $y_{j}$ is not linear.
Linear least-squares problem are useful because the minimisation problem can be formulated as a linear set of equations and written compactly in matrix form.
